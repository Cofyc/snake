Using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` or arrow keys to turn snake around.

Type `q` or `<ESC>` to quit game.

Type `<space>` to pause/restore game.

Playing on Mac OS X
===================

I strongly recommend iTerm2 (<http://www.iterm2.com/>), because Mac OS X native Terminal cannot hide the terminal cursor which is very annoying!.
